Comp 20 Lab 9

1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The purpose of the Git repository is to keep track of file and program
versions remotely. Also it is used so that my work is more readily
available to the graders. 

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was notuber because The end product that I 
accomplished felt very satisfying because it felt very close to a 
real app that someone might use in daily life. 

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to 
now?

I think I have learned and grown a good amount in this couse. I am 
much more knowledgable now and I have a better grasp on group computer
science work.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course?
Cite two examples as evidence.

First I learned how to use git and Github which I think is extremely 
important because no matter what field I go into in computer science
in the future I will be using git and Github. Second I learned how 
client side interacts with the server side which was something I had
no idea how it worked beforehand.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like
to delve deeper into?

I want to delve deeper into security which is why I am taking security
next semester.
