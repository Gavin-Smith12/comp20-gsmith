1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented 
and what have not.

All aspects should be implemented correctly.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the 
assignment.

I have colaborated with George West and Ravi Serota.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the 
assignment.

I spent about 5 or so hours on this (took me a while to figure out
why my information was being parsed).
