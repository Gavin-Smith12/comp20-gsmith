    <h1>Assignment 4</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
     I have been hired to find vulnerabilities in the
     implementation of Samantha Stolzenbach's ride sharing service.
     This service uses Heroku. The drivers and riders information
     is stored using MongoDB.
    </p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <p>
    I attempted to use cross site scripting to inject javascript
    into the webpage, but after it did not work I looked at the 
    source code of the webpage and found that all of the 
    greater thans and less thans had been sanatized to 
    "&amplt" and "&ampgt" using an ejs file which is a framework for
    html files, so cross site scripting is now for the most part
    impossible (at least for my knowledge).
    </p>
    <p>
    Next I attempted to use MongoDB injections to gain access 
    to many users information but I realized that this was not
    possible because in the vechile.json get the user checks
    the given username against a static array rather than in
    the actual database. For this section I attempted to use
    Burp Suite.        
    </p>
    <p>
    Then I analyzed the process through which information was
    actually given to the website and given by the website.
    This led me to my conclusion about the issue regarding
    the same-origin policy. This also led me to realize
    that the website did not require information to be 
    sent with an HTTPS request.     
    </p>
    <p>
    Lastly I wrote a shell script that sent a lot of user
    information to the website to test if I would get shut
    out after a large number of requests in a small amount
    of time.        
    </p>

    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

    <p>
    Overall many of the obvious vulnerabilies that one would
    expect a website to have were covered with this program.
    Cross site scripting and database injections are almost
    impossible because of the security precautions that have
    been taken. What was wrong was first that this website
    does not check who is requesting information from the 
    website so virtually anybody can access any data from
    the website. Second, this website does not make sure
    that the connection to it is encrypted to the information
    can be accessed by an intermediary. Lastly, this website
    does not limit the amount of data that one user can
    input in a period of time which could cause the website
    to become very cluttered and potentially could bring
    the website down. The fixes of all of these problems
    are all fairly easy to fix as I outline below.        
    </p>

    <h2>Issues Found</h2>

    <h3>Issue 1: Same-Origin Policy and User Information</h3>

    <p>
    The first issue that I found is that the information of 
    both the users and the drivers are accessable to anyone
    on any device. The website does not check where the 
    information request is coming from, so any website or
    person can request data, and because the usernames of
    either the drivers or passengers (depending on what
    you intially put in) is displayed, one can just input
    the opposite kind of username and receive the information
    of everyone.         
    </p>
    <p>
    I found this issue when I realized that every user has access
    to all the usernames of both the passengers and drivers, so 
    if a malicious passenger wanted to get the locations of all
    of the other passengers this is easily achieveable. This is 
    a moderate to severe issue because a lot of information is 
    available, but none of it is extremely critical.
    </p>

    <p>
    To fix this issue first off I would not return the usernames
    in the JSON string that is returned upon a successful request.
    The drivers only need to know a basic name for the passengers
    and their location and same for the passengers, displaying
    their actual username is useless and only allows for breaches.
    Also they could just implement a password system to make
    it so that knowing the username only allows users access
    to information. Also I would make sure that the website checks
    each request to make sure that is a trustworthy source
    to give information to.
    </p>

    <h3>Issue 2: HTTP Usage</h3>

    <p>
    The second issue that I found is that the this website 
    accepts request from HTTP requests in addition to 
    HTTPS requests. As can be seen by the picture below,
    I requested information from the website and the 
    request went through even though the link that I
    provided used HTTP. This issue is moderate to severe because
    using HTTP means that the connection is not encrypted which
    makes it much easier for an intermediary to get the
    information that is being passed.     
    </p>
    <img src="http_usage.png" alt="Using HTTP">
    <p>
    To fix this issue I would recommend the website only 
    accepting requests from HTTPS requests rather than
    not descriminating. Also make it so that requests
    to access the website through HTTP redirect to HTTPS.      
    </p>

    <h3>Issue 3: User Overload</h3>

    <p>
    Lastly I found that as a user I had the power to make 
    unlimited requests to the website. I wrote a script that
    made thousands of requests in only a minute or so. Due to
    this both the actual website along with the data that the
    drivers see can be rendered completely useless. With all
    of the data being obscured by the data that I am sending
    drivers will not be able to actually parse through the 
    data and see who the actual drivers are. In addition to 
    this allowing one address to have unlimited requests 
    makes things like DDOS attacks much easier. Overall this
    issue is moderate as it does not actually pose a great
    threat to the website but rather is mostly an 
    aesthetic issue.        
    </p>
    <p>
    The website being overloaded with requests.        
    </p>

    <p>
    The data that the driver sees being overloaded with 
    requests.        
    </p>

    <p>
    To fix this issue I would just make sure that one IP can
    only make so many requests in a certain amount of time.
    After they make that many requests they should have to 
    wait a certain period of time before making another 
    request.        
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
    Overall the security of this website is fairly good, 
    covering things like cross site scripting and database
    injections. My main concern was with restricting user 
    requests. At this point users can make requests from 
    anywhere, through an unencrypted connection, and make
    an unlimited amount of requests. These vulnerabilities
    pose a big problem for this website but overall can
    be fixed relatively easily. In the future I would
    recommend making sure that users are heavily restricted
    in what information they are able to access through
    the regular function of the website. Users should not 
    be trusted so making sure that they are using the 
    website as it is intended is important.
